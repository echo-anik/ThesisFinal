WHY THIS COMBINATION?
=====================

EDGE: Random Forest
  ✅ Fast inference (110-200ms)
  ✅ Small memory footprint (5.9MB)
  ✅ Interpretable decisions
  ✅ Handles non-linear patterns
  ✅ Works well with limited data (5-25%)

CENTRAL: Gradient Boosting
  ✅ Superior accuracy (F1=0.9827)
  ✅ Learns from edge model mistakes
  ✅ Computationally heavy but necessary
  ✅ Better for complex patterns
  ✅ Can process escalated hard cases


PERFORMANCE METRICS
===================

F1 Score: 0.9827 (98.27% effectiveness)
Precision: 0.9676 (96.76% accurate alarms)
Recall: 0.9982 (99.82% attack detection)
Accuracy: 0.9997 (99.97% correct decisions)

Attack Detection: 2,273 out of 2,277 = 99.8%
False Alarms: 76 out of 233,883 benign = 0.03%
Missed Attacks: 4 out of 2,277 = 0.2%


RESOURCE PROFILE (Raspberry Pi 4)
=================================

Edge Model Size: 5.9 MB (fits easily on Pi)
Central Model: Not on Pi (runs on server)
Inference Time: 198 ms per sample
Power Draw: 2.204 W (ultra-low for 24/7 operation)
Memory Usage: <300 MB on Pi
Uptime: 24/7 capable

Annual Power Cost: ~$3 at typical rates


HIERARCHICAL ARCHITECTURE
==========================

Design:
  Edge Pi → Makes fast decisions
         → Sends uncertain cases to central
  
  Central Server → Processes escalated cases
                → Returns final decision
                → Logs all detections

Escalation Rate: 1.6-2.2% of traffic (very low!)
  Meaning: Edge handles 98% locally
          Central only processes 2% of cases

Network Load: Minimal (only escalations sent)

  - Smallest models (0.88MB)
  - Weakest edge (F1=0.21)
  - Highest escalation (10.9%)
  - Lightweight but less effective

Config_5_OptimalBalance:
  - RF edge + GB central
  - Similar to Config_2
  - Slightly lower F1 (0.9824)
  - Middle ground

  - Largest models (6.27MB)
  - Best central accuracy
  - Lowest escalation (1.6%)
  - Maximum accuracy focus


FOR YOUR THESIS
===============

You can reference this as:

"We implement a hierarchical intrusion detection system using 
a Balanced Random Forest (100 trees, depth 20) on edge devices 
and a Gradient Boosting Classifier (200 rounds, depth 7) on 
the central server, achieving F1=0.9827 with only 1.6-2.2% 
escalation overhead."

Or more simply:

"Our system combines Random Forest edge detection with 
Gradient Boosting central analysis, achieving 0.9827 F1 
while keeping edge device power consumption below 2.2W."

Or academic style:

"We evaluated six hierarchical IDS configurations. 
Config_2_Balanced, using a 100-tree Random Forest on edge 
and a 200-round Gradient Boosting on central, emerged as 
optimal, balancing accuracy (F1=0.9827), resource efficiency 
(5.9MB, 2.2W), and network efficiency (1.6% escalation)."


REPRODUCIBILITY CODE
====================

Edge Model Creation:
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
  edge_model = RandomForestClassifier(
      n_estimators=100,
      max_depth=20,
      min_samples_split=10,
      min_samples_leaf=5,
      class_weight='balanced',
      random_state=42,
      n_jobs=-1
  )
  edge_model.fit(X_train_5pct, y_train_5pct)

Central Model Creation:
  from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
  central_model = GradientBoostingClassifier(
      n_estimators=200,
      max_depth=7,
      learning_rate=0.1,
      random_state=42
  )
  central_model.fit(X_train_100pct, y_train_100pct)

Inference with Escalation:
  # Edge inference
  edge_pred = edge_model.predict(X_test)
  edge_proba = edge_model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
  
  # Escalation: if attack OR uncertain
  edge_uncertain = (edge_proba > 0.4) & (edge_proba < 0.6)
  escalate_mask = (edge_pred == 1) | edge_uncertain
  
  # Central inference (only for escalated)
  final_pred = edge_pred.copy()
  final_pred[escalate_mask] = central_model.predict(X_test[escalate_mask])


MODEL SELECTION JUSTIFICATION
=============================

Why Random Forest for Edge?
  1. Inference speed (110ms acceptable for ICS)
  2. Small footprint (5.9MB fits Pi easily)
  3. Robust to different data distributions
  4. Can be updated incrementally
  5. Interpretable for operators

Why Gradient Boosting for Central?
  1. Superior accuracy despite complexity
  2. Better error correction
  3. Can afford compute (server resource)
  4. Only processes 1.6% of samples
  5. Network latency tolerable for central decisions

Why This Hierarchy?
  1. Minimize edge latency (RF vs GB saves 100+ms)
  2. Maximize system accuracy (GB central corrects edge errors)
  3. Reduce network traffic (only 1.6% escalation)
  4. Optimize power budget (edge very low power)
  5. Maintain responsiveness (<200ms p99)
