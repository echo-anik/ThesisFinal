\section*{Abstract}
Securing the expansive Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem presents a significant challenge, making effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) essential for protecting diverse and often resource-constrained devices. This problem is especially critical in Industrial IoT (IIoT) environments, where standard machine learning models struggle to provide reliable, real-time threat detection without generating excessive false alarms. To address this, our research conducts a rigorous benchmark of eight machine learning and deep learning models on the modern HAI 22.04 industrial dataset. The findings establish the definitive superiority of tuned tree-based ensembles, with XGBoost achieving a state-of-the-art F1-Score and Recall of 0.97. These models decisively outperformed both baseline classifiers and standard Recurrent Neural Networks, which proved unstable for this task. This study contributes a reproducible benchmark, identifying gradient boosting as a practical and high-performance solution for securing critical infrastructure. Future work should focus on hybrid model fusion and explainable AI to further enhance detection robustness and operational trust.
